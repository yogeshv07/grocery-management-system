# Inventory Restoration on Order Cancellation

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The system now automatically restores product stock when orders are cancelled.

## How It Works

### 1. **Backend Order Cancellation** (`orderController.js`)
When a user cancels an order:
- Validates the order can be cancelled (not delivered/already cancelled)
- Loops through all items in the order
- Calls `Product.restoreStock(productId, quantity)` for each item
- Updates order status to "cancelled"
- Sets `stockDeducted = false` to prevent double restoration

```javascript
// Example from cancelOrder controller
if (order.stockDeducted) {
  for (const item of order.items) {
    await Product.restoreStock(item.product, item.quantity);
  }
  order.stockDeducted = false;
}
```

### 2. **Product Model** (`Product.js`)
Has a static method `restoreStock()` that:
- Finds the product by ID
- Increases stock by the specified quantity
- Validates the product exists
- Updates stock status and history

### 3. **Frontend** (`OrderHistory.jsx`)
- Shows "Cancel Order" button for pending/confirmed/preparing orders
- Displays confirmation dialog informing user about stock restoration
- Shows success message confirming inventory was restored
- Auto-refreshes order list after cancellation

## User Experience

### Cancel Button Visibility
Users can cancel orders with these statuses:
- ✅ **Pending** - Order just placed
- ✅ **Confirmed** - Order confirmed by admin
- ✅ **Preparing** - Order being prepared
- ❌ **Out for Delivery** - Cannot cancel (already dispatched)
- ❌ **Delivered** - Cannot cancel (completed)
- ❌ **Cancelled** - Already cancelled

### Confirmation Dialog
```
"Are you sure you want to cancel this order?

Note: Product stock will be automatically restored."
```

### Success Message
```
"Order cancelled successfully! Inventory has been restored."
```

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint
```
PUT /api/orders/:orderId/cancel
```

### Response
```json
{
  "message": "Order cancelled successfully and stock restored",
  "order": { /* updated order object */ }
}
```

### Stock Restoration Process
1. Order is found and validated
2. For each item in order:
   - Product stock += item.quantity
   - Stock history is updated
3. Order status changed to "cancelled"
4. Order.stockDeducted set to false
5. Response sent to frontend

## Safety Features

### Prevents Double Restoration
- `stockDeducted` flag prevents restoring stock multiple times
- Only restores if flag is `true`

### Validation Checks
- Order must exist
- Order cannot be delivered or already cancelled
- Product must exist before stock restoration

### Error Handling
- Graceful error messages if restoration fails
- Transaction-like behavior (all or nothing)
- Console logging for debugging

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Cancel Pending Order
1. Place an order with 2 items (Laptop x1, Phone x2)
2. Check product stocks decrease
3. Cancel the order from Order History
4. Verify stocks are restored:
   - Laptop stock +1
   - Phone stock +2

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Cancellations
1. Try to cancel the same order twice
2. Stock should only restore once
3. Second attempt should fail with error

### Test Scenario 3: Delivered Order
1. Complete an order (mark as delivered)
2. Try to cancel from Order History
3. Cancel button should not appear

## Files Modified

1. **Backend Routes** (`routes/orderRoutes.js`)
   - Imported `cancelOrder` controller
   - Updated cancel route to use proper controller

2. **Frontend** (`pages/OrderHistory.jsx`)
   - Enhanced cancel confirmation message
   - Added stock restoration notification
   - Auto-refresh after cancellation

## Admin Dashboard Impact

When admin cancels order via dashboard:
- Uses same stock restoration logic
- Available in `updateOrderStatus` controller
- Restores stock when status changes to "cancelled"

## Database Schema

### Order Model
```javascript
{
  stockDeducted: Boolean, // Tracks if stock was deducted
  status: String,         // Order status
  items: [{
    product: ObjectId,    // Product reference
    quantity: Number      // Quantity ordered
  }]
}
```

## Summary

✅ **Stock automatically restored** when order cancelled
✅ **Prevents double restoration** with stockDeducted flag
✅ **User-friendly messaging** about inventory changes
✅ **Works for both** customer cancellation and admin cancellation
✅ **Safe and validated** with proper error handling

**Note**: Ensure backend server is restarted to pick up route changes!
